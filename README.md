About
-----

YouMeIBD is a place for the IBD community to connect. The ultimate goal of YouMeIBD is to enrich and improve the life of people living with IBD. We connect users based on their interest, location and expertise. By doing so, we want to build up a vivid and intelligent swarm of patients to collectively find the right answers to questions that people share.

The Code is Open Source and can be found in this repository. The Code is maintained by the ICKN Team (http://www.ickn.org) and Pull Requests are welcome. The project dates back to 2010/2011 when an idea for a platform integrated into Facebook was described. The original paper can be found here: http://www.ickn.org/documents/COINs11_YouApp.pdf. In the context of an international university course called the "COIN Seminar", the idea was implemented by various teams. At one point the name was changed to YouMeIBD, since there existed already an App called YouApp.
