<h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
<p>
	The Terms of Use set forth below are binding on all users of this Website. By directing your browser to this Website or otherwise accessing the pages of this Website, you accept these Terms of Use. YouApp may change the Terms of Use at any time at its sole discretion. YouApp reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to deny further or continuing access to the Website to any visitor, including, without limitation, any user that YouApp determines has violated any aspect of these Terms of Use.

<h2>Personal safety</h2>
<p>
	YOUAPP STRONGLY ADVISES YOU TO USE EXTREME CAUTION BEFORE SHARING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION WITH OTHER USERS OF THIS WEBSITE.
	Your safety and security are very important to us. The nature of this Website promotes the sharing of personal information by users with other users. YouApp cannot and does not assure that it is safe for you to have direct contact with other users of this Website. Current technological developments make it possible for users of the Internet to obtain personal information about, and locate, other users, with very little other information. For example, it is possible to use certain widely available commercial Internet search engines to locate a person’s home solely using that person’s correct name. If you believe that any user of this Website is harassing you or is otherwise using personal information about you for unlawful purposes, we encourage you to first inform local law enforcement authorities and then to contact us via e-mail so that we may take appropriate action to block further use of the Website by any user who is using this Website and information obtained from it for improper purposes.
	By accessing this Website, you agree to use any personal information provided to you by other users of this Website in a lawful and responsible manner. You further agree that you will not use personal information about other users of this Website for any reason without the express prior consent of the user that has provided such information to you.

</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>
	YouApp uses industry standard efforts, such as firewalls, to safeguard the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information.
